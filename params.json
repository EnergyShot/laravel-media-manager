Note that this package is still under development.\r\nYou can use this file manager in Laravel 4 as a standalone media manager or as a plugin for TinyMCE or CKEditor. For more info take a look at files in `src/views` folder.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nFirst of all you should add laravel-media-manager package to your composer.json file using this line:\r\n\r\n    \"ahmadazimi/laravel-media-manager\": \"dev-master\",\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAdd the MediaManagerServiceProvider to your application providers by adding this line to providers array in app/config/app.php:\r\n\r\n    'W3G\\MediaManager\\MediaManagerServiceProvider',\r\n\r\nTo copy the Media Manager assets to the public folder, using the following artisan command:\r\n\r\n    php artisan mediamanager:publish\r\n\t\r\nAlso remember to publish the assets after each update (or add the command to your post-update-cmd in composer.json)\r\n\r\nYou can now add the routes for elFinder to your routes.php\r\n\r\n    Route::group(array('before' => 'auth'), function()\r\n        {\r\n            \\Route::get('media', 'W3G\\MediaManager\\MediaManagerController@showStandalone');\r\n            \\Route::any('media/connector', 'W3G\\MediaManager\\MediaManagerController@connector');\r\n        });\r\n\r\nOf course you can define your own filters/routes if you want.\r\n\t\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nThe default configuration requires a directory called 'media' in the public folder. You can change this by publishing the config file.\r\n\r\n    php artisan config:publish ahmadazimi/laravel-media-manager\r\n\r\nIn your app/config/packages/ahmadazimi/laravel-media-manager, you can change the default folder, the access callback or define your own roots and also some extra parameters for elFinder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
